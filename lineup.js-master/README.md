LineUp.js: Visual Analysis of Multi-Attribute Rankings
======
LineUp is an interactive technique designed to create, visualize and explore rankings of items based on a set of heterogeneous attributes. This is a D3-based re-implementation with limited functionality relative to the original stand-alone LineUp, which you can check out at http://lineup.caleydo.org
